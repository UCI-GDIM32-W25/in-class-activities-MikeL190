### Activity 1
Have others playtest your game so that they might find bugs that you might not know exist

### Activity 2
#### Q1
x = 10
#### Q2
x = 2
#### Q3
The text "hello world" will get printed out in the terminal window very fast, like every frame
#### Q4
MonoBehavior
#### Q5
The text "x = 10" will get printed out, since that's what gets passed as an argument into the function, and even though 10 is an int, the program will automatically convert the int into a string (implicit conversion I think it's called) 
#### Q6
The variables have not been initialized. Neither the _playerTransform and _direction variables have not been given values. Also, you are calling Translate on the Transform class as if it were a static method, when Translate should instead be called on an instance of the Transform class.
#### Q7
For this specific case, you just have to make Transform lowercase, so that it references the current script's Transform component that the script is attached to. But also the _direction variable should be set to a certain value, otherwise the object that the script is attached to won't get moved anywhere.
